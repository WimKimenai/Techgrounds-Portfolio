Loops

## Key terminology
[Write a list of key terminology with a short description. To prevent duplication you can reference to previous excercises.]

## Exercise

**Exercise 1:**

* Create a new script.
* Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
* Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.  


**Exercise 2:**  

* Create a new script.
* Copy the code below into your script.
* Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
* Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
* Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

**Exercise 3:**  

* Create a new script.
* Copy the array below into your script.
arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]
* Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.

**Exercise 2:**  

There is no value "i" so it doesn't show anything when you run it. It's somewhere in the range of 10, but the value is not being stored anywhere.  

**Exercise 3:**

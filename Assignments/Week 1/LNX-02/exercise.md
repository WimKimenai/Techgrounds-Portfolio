Navigating around Linux and creating & editing files.

## Key terminology
Terminal:  
The terminal is a command-line interface on MacOS, similarly Windows uses Powershell.   

Root:  
The root user in Linux, which is similar to the Administrator account on Windows. The root user contains all permissions and has full control over the system.  

Path:  
The directory written in text on an operating system.  

Command ls:  
A UNIX command to list files and directories in the command line interface.

Command mkdir:  
A UNIX command to make a new directory (folder).  

Command nano:  
The nano command is a command to open the nano text editor in UNIX command-line interfaces.  

Command pwd:  
A UNIX command to print the current working directory in the command-line interface. It has an easy and user-friendly graphical interface.
## Exercise

* Find out your current working directory.  
* Make a listing of all files and directories in your home directory. You should see directories like ‘Desktop’, ‘Public’ and ‘Pictures’ among others.  
* Within your home directory, create a new directory named ‘techgrounds’.  
* Within the techgrounds directory, create a file containing some text.  
* Move around your directory tree using both absolute and relative paths.

### Overcome challenges
I had some issues understanding absolute and relative paths. After viewing the YouTube video I included in my sources a few times and actively trying out different methods in Linux I came to have a good understanding of it.

### Results
I completed the exercise and gained more knowledge about files and directories in Linux.  

Here I found out my current working directory using pwd:

Here I listed all files and directories in my home directory:

Here I created a new directory named 'techgrounds':

Here I create a text file within the techgrounds directory:
